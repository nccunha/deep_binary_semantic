# Multispectral Image Segmentation in Agriculture: A Comprehensive Study on Fusion Approaches

This repository contains the code developed for the studies presented in the paper:
[Multispectral Image Segmentation in Agriculture: A Comprehensive Study on Fusion Approaches](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-59167-9_26).

In this work, we explore and compare various fusion strategies that combine RGB and NDVI inputs for crop row and vine segmentation.
The study evaluates both classical and deep learning-based segmentation approaches, demonstrating the strengths of late fusion techniques and the continued relevance of traditional methods in precision agriculture.

## Dataset #2 - Vineyards (referred to as Vine in project folders)

This dataset merges data from three distinct vineyard sources: Valdoeiro, Quinta de Baixo, and ESAC.

It was first introduced in the following publication:

[Multispectral vineyard segmentation: A deep learning comparison study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168169922000990).
